                    In 1983, Carlos Sosa pka DJ Sneak, moved to the city of Chicago from The island of Puerto Rico, where
                    his early musical experiences and Influences were rooted in salsa, meringue and famous Latin orchestras.

                <p>
                    Chicago, like Puerto Rico, is a city rich with musical styles and sounds. It was in Chicago that Sneak
                    found inspiration in underground house music, Warehouse parties and "old school" mix tapes from the
                    early pioneers - Farley Jackmaster Funk, Ralphi Rosario, Steve Hurley and local radio station shows
                    played on WBMX.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sneak earned his nickname rocking designs in the graffiti tagging days and began working at retail
                    stores as an airbrush artist, not long after he cultured the music industry world and began recording
                    his first releases. While at retail stores Sneak developed his DJing skills around the city working
                    regular mobile DJ jobs and local nightclubs. In an already saturated DJ pool, sneak focused on music
                    production and started an independent label - Defiant Records.

                    In 1992, using the fundamental studio pieces, Sneak began recording tracks with an unusual new style. In
                    1994, while still working at local store Gramophone Records sneak met Cajmere 
                    (<a href="https://ra.co/dj/greenvelvet" target="_blank" >Green Velvet</a> ) owner of
                    Cajual and Relief Records. Cajmere released some of sneak's pivotal tracks and helped bring
                    international recognition, with it, a global DJing career.

                    In 1995, sneak's new sound revolutionized house music with inspirational sounds and rhythms never heard.
                    The disco filtered house grooves became sneak's signature sound. Innovator to many, sneak's love for
                    music spawned current talents such as Daft Punk, Basement Jaxx, Armand Van Helden. In 1996, Dj Sneak's"
                    You can't hide from your bud" on Derrick Carter's Classic Recordings turn out to be something of a
                    masterpiece, setting a blueprint for many subsequent 'filtered disco'tracks and preceding the wave of
                    funky, disco-influenced house that would prove the massive popularity of Chicago underground music.
