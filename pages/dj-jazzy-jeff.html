                    In 1985, Jeffrey Allen Townes exploded onto the music scene as half of the superstar duo known as DJ
                    Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince (longtime partner/performer/actor, Will Smith). Since then they have
                    gone on to sell over ten million records worldwide. The infamous pop-rap pair has also won three Grammy
                    Awards, three American Music Awards, two NAACP Awards, two Soul Train Music Awards, as well as an MTV
                    Music Award.

                    In 1990, Jeff fulfilled his longtime dream and started A Touch of Jazz, Inc. in his hometown of
                    Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A Touch of Jazz Studios also has a variety of vintage microphones, keyboards
                    and gear. Pre-production, recording, and mixing are performed magically and almost effortlessly by a
                    team of talented young producers. Jazzy Jeff prides himself on the laid-back atmosphere that allows all
                    those who enter to feel unity and inspiration. The result of this relaxed attitude is what has made ATOJ
                    renowned and revered as THE place to create music.

                    A Touch of Jazz, Inc. has various musical credits to its name including the theme to “The Fresh Prince
                    of Bel Air” television show, a song on “The Simpsons” compilation album and the theme to the UPN
                    Network’s “Between Brothers.” ATOJ produced songs on the “Wild Wild West,” “Love Jones,” “The Wood,” and
                    “In Too Deep” movie soundtracks. A Touch of Jazz has also worked with Kenny Lattimore, Tatyana Ali, MC
                    Lyte, Darius Rucker (front man for Hootie and the Blowfish), and pop star Jewel, who has ATOJ releases
                    on both her latest release, “0304,” and an upcoming album by hip hop violinist Miri Ben Ari. Jeff
                    produced three songs on Will Smith’s first solo album and served as executive producer on Will’s second
                    solo project, aptly titled “Willenium, “ which is now multi-platinum. The duo is currently in studio now
                    working on songs for Will’s not yet titled release due this fall, and they have just wrapped up an
                    International tour for Fox Films promoting the Will Smith action film, I-Robot.

                    While creating material for outside artists, A Touch of Jazz is now developing its own roster of talent
                    to present to the world. In Summer 2000, A Touch of Jazz produced Jill Scott’s debut album “Who is Jill
                    Scott? Words and Sound Vol. 1.” Jeff executive produced Jill’s now multi-platinum album and serves as
                    executive producer again on her highly anticipated sophomore effort, “Beautifully Human: Words & Sounds
                    vol. 2.” As well as being the signature for Philly sound and flavor, Jill Scott has won accolades
                    worldwide and several Grammy nominations. Musiq Soulchild’s debut album, “Aijuswanaseing,“ also produced
                    by ATOJ, is complimentary to the studio’s millennium climax of performers, along with Floetry, whose
                    DreamWorks debut has earned them both BET Award & Grammy Award nominations.

                <p>
                    Jeff’s success as a producer preempted his brilliant insight as founder and CEO of A Touch of Jazz, Inc.
                    and now his instincts are leading him to sculpt, perfect and project his already definitive music into
                    the future. Jazzy Jeff and his producers’ A Touch Of Jazz style have succeeded in providing acts with
                    substance and stability. 2005 holds only hope and anticipation for the growth enterprise A Touch of Jazz
                    has already become, built by the man that has already been.
