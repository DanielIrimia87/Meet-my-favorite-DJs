                Chus L. Esteban, aka DJ CHUS, born and raised in Madrid, Spain (1971),
                started his professional career at the end of the '80s in his home
                town, amidst the full-blown euphoria of the acid-house movement at
                Club' Alien', one of the first clubs of the famous Kapital Group in
                Madrid. In August of 1992, he becomes the resident DJ at the legendary
                'Kadoc' Club in the Portuguese Algarve. He shared the DJ booth with
                the best international Electronic acts at that time, witnessing from a
                privileged position the dance music explosion during the 90â€²s. His
                style, influenced by the Portuguese and American underground sounds,
                definitely converged into house music inspired by Disco, Latin, and
                World Music.
            </p>

                In 1994, Chus became resident DJ of the first emblematic House Club in
                Madrid at Teatro Kapital, lasting ten years. He soon developed a
                passion for the art of electronic music production, working with the
                bests professionals in Madrid like David Penn, D-Formation, or Oscar
                L. Chus created a personal vision of underground house music called
                the 'Iberican Sound' influenced by the culture of Spain and Portugal,
                but was along with Ceballos, whose techno background gelled with
                Chus's House style when this fusion turned up the 'Iberican Sound'
                becoming into a worldwide movement.

                His Music style is a delicious blend of Organic House, warm and
                intense with a vital and profound Tribal essence that fuses naturally
                with melodic and evolving sounds, percussion rhythms, and drums. A
                long-haul career based on his self-taught character and his constant
                defense of musical quality has turned him into one of the industry's
                most respected DJs. Chus's strength resides in his charisma and the
                unique and pure way he chooses to engage with people.

                as Defected, Nervous, and his Stereo Productions show his wide range
                of music styles and unlimited love for different genres. His blend of
                styles is his dogma and the quality, his message.
