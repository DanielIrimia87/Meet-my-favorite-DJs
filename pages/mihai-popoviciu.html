                    Mihai Popoviciu, from Sibiu in Romania, is considered one of the most innovative eastern European
                    producers of electronic music today. He was born in Romania in 1981 and was drawn to the fast-growing
                    rave scene of the 90’s.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He started producing music in 2001 being influenced by the techno and house virus and it took many years
                    of experiments untill he came up with his first vinyl release on DJ Hell’s imprint Gigolo Records in 2005.
                    Since then he has steadily added chapters to his personal success story with solo projects and those
                    with partners like Markus Homm or Jay Bliss.

                    labels such as Fear Of Flying, Hudd Traxx, Bang Bang or Diynamic.The club hit Bis Co (produced together 
                    with Markus and Jay Bliss) was featured in all major dance charts across Europe and confirmed once again 
                    his fine producing skills. When teaming up with Jay Bliss the duo call themselves Hermannstadt Collective, 
                    a dj and producing team that has made big waves on the dancefloors all over the world with tracks like
